# Drift Database Tutorial

## Introduction

This repository contains an updated version of a Drift database tutorial initially created by Reso Coder Labs. The tutorial covers advanced queries, DAOs (Data Access Objects), joins, and migrations for the Drift database. While the original tutorial was released three years ago, I have made necessary updates to ensure that the code remains relevant and functional.

If you're interested in learning about Drift or improving your understanding of advanced database concepts, this project can be a valuable resource for you üòÅ
